# E-Commerce-Product-Page
-  I built a front-end e-commerce product page for wireless earbuds.
-  This webpage displays complete information about a product and allows users to interact with it like an online shopping website.

-  The page contains a navigation bar with options such as Home, Brands, Services, Cart, About, and a search bar to search products.

- The main section shows the earbuds product with its image on one side and the product details on the other side.
- It includes the product name, description, original price, discounted price, and discount percentage so that users can clearly understand the offer.

- The page also provides color options like black and white.
- When the user selects a color, the product image changes accordingly.

- An "Add to Cart" button is provided to add the product to the cart.
- When clicked, the cart item count increases dynamically.

- HTML is used to create the structure of the webpage, CSS is used to design and style the layout, and JavaScript is used to add interactive features such as image switching, discount calculation, and cart updating.

- This project simulates a simple online shopping product page similar to e-commerce websites.
